I got a chance to share a short lightning talk at the LibrePlanet 2022 free-software conference a few weeks agao.  The talk describes some of the motivations for Haven and the ways that Facebook fails it's purported mission.

As I've shared this video with more people, they tell me is really helped them understand the value that a system like Haven can provide.  I hope you find it useful too!

You can find a recording on the [LibrePlanet website](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/lightning-talk-private-blogs-are-a-better-social-internet/), or watch the video below.
