<p>Running your own server gives you the most control over your site and we think it is the best way to run your Haven.   But we know that doing it yourself is hard and takes specialized knowledge.  We want to make it as easy as possible for <em>all</em> people to create a safe space to post privately, and share with their friends without subjecting them to big-tech tracking or ads.</p>
<p>For these reasons we're offering to host a Haven for you. You can try the Haven demo below to see what it's like&mdash;no credit card required.  For $5 per month, we will run your private blog on a subdomain of havenweb.org on a dedicated virtual server.  A subdomain means your site will live at something like <code>example.havenweb.org</code>.  A dedicated server means only your Haven runs on that server, it isn't shared with anyone else.  Go ahead and give it a try!</p>

<p>This demo gives you a chance to try out publishing and reading on Haven to see how it works.  It doesn't give you full access for setting custom styles or creating users. Note that demo user accounts get purged periodically.
