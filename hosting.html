<p>Running your own server gives you the most control over your site and we think it is the best way to run your Haven.   But we know that doing it yourself is hard and takes specialized knowledge.  We want to make it as easy as possible for <em>all</em> people to create a safe space to post privately, and share with their friends without subjecting them to big-tech tracking or ads.</p>
<p>For these reasons we're offering to host a Haven for you. You can try a hosted Haven for free for a week to see what it's like--no credit card required.  For $5 per month after that, your private blog will be hosted on a subdomain of havenweb.org on a dedicated virtual server.  A subdomain means your site will live at something like <code>alice.havenweb.org</code>.  If you want to use a custom domain that you already own, you can have that domain point to your hosted Haven, or you can pay $10 per month to have us host it on a dedicated domain.
