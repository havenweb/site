<p>Haven puts you in complete control of what you write.  You choose who gets to see it instead of trusting a big company to control who gets access on your behalf. Share pictures of your kids with family and friends; share private thoughts with those you trust most; you're in control with no ads, and no tracking.</p>
<p>Haven is open source, and free for you to run on your own server.  We've made it as easy as possible to get running on Amazon AWS and you can run it on a Raspberry PI in your living room or anywhere else.  If running it yourself is too daunting, we can host it for you on your own dedicated virtual server for $5 per month.</p>
