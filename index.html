<h2>Own Your Online Space: True Privacy, Total Control</h2>

<p>Haven gives you back control over your online expression. You decide what to share and who sees itâ€”no algorithms, no data mining, no corporate gatekeepers. Share precious family moments, personal reflections, or creative work with only your chosen circle. Experience an internet free from ads and trackers, where your content serves <em>you</em>, not advertisers.</p>

<h2>Reclaiming Digital Independence: Why Haven Exists</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/undraw_fatherhood_7i19.svg" alt="Father with son, symbolizing personal connection and privacy"></img>
<p>Haven was born from a desire for authentic connection, free from the compromises of mainstream social media. I wanted a space to share photos of my newborn daughter with loved ones, without wrestling with complex platforms or worrying about privacy breaches and relentless spam. It became clear that many people craved the same: a simple, secure way to share online, on their own terms. Traditional platforms are "free" because they harvest your data. Haven is built on a different philosophy: data sovereignty, open-source principles, and empowering you to own your digital life. We believe you shouldn't have to trade your privacy for connection.</p>

<h2>Haven: Your Private Hub for Sharing and Connecting</h2>
<p>Haven is your personal, private website and blog, running on a server you control. It's like WordPress, but designed from the ground up for privacy. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create and Share:</strong> Write posts, share updates, and include pictures, just like any other blogging platform.</li>
  <li><strong>You're the Gatekeeper:</strong> Unlike public platforms, your Haven is private by default. Google can't index your posts. Only people you explicitly grant access can view your content.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible Hosting:</strong> Being <a href="https://github.com/havenweb/haven">open source</a>, Haven is free to run on your own server. We provide guides for <a href="https://github.com/havenweb/haven/blob/master/README.md#aws">Amazon AWS</a> or even a <a href="https://github.com/havenweb/haven/blob/master/README.md#raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a>. If you prefer a hands-off approach, we offer a managed hosting service for $5 per month on your own dedicated virtual server.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated Reader:</strong> Haven isn't just for posting; it's also for reading. Curate a private feed of websites you follow, including other Havens, creating your own ad-free, algorithm-free reading space.
